# ETHINICITY DETECTION MODEL


## Overview

Ethinicity detection model is a project focused on classifying races using facial images from the FairFace dataset. The goal is to accurately identify the race of individuals depicted in images. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its purpose, dataset, models used, exploratory data analysis (EDA), setup instructions, and usage guide.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify the race of individuals based on facial images. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and pre-trained models, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in race classification tasks.

## Dataset

The FairFace dataset is used in this project, which contains facial images of individuals from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. The dataset is pre-processed and augmented to ensure a diverse and balanced representation of different races. It includes images labeled with the corresponding race of the individuals, facilitating supervised learning tasks.

## Models Used

### VGG16 Face Model Architecture

The repository implements the VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16) Face Model Architecture for race classification. This deep learning model architecture comprises multiple convolutional blocks, each consisting of convolutional layers capturing various levels of abstraction and complexity, followed by ReLU activation functions and max-pooling layers for downsampling. Utilizing transfer learning techniques, the model demonstrates robust performance in accurately classifying races based on facial features.

### Transfer Learning Techniques

Transfer learning techniques are employed to enhance the performance of the VGG16 model for race classification. By fine-tuning the pre-trained weights and adjusting the model architecture, transfer learning enables the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the FairFace dataset. This approach improves the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase involves analyzing the FairFace dataset to gain insights into the distribution of racial categories, image characteristics, and potential challenges in race classification. EDA techniques such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and data preprocessing are employed to understand the dataset's properties and inform model development strategies.
